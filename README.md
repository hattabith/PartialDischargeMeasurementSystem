# PartialDischargeMeasurementSystem
Partial discharge measurement system

## Main idea

The program is designed for measuring **partial discharges** (PD) and calculating their energy under specific conditions.   
Measuring and analyzing PD is of paramount importance in the context of studying processes in insulation, as well as for preventing equipment malfunctions during operation. According to international standards, a partial discharge is defined as an electrical discharge that is locally bypassed by insulation on a specific section of the structure.   
Although these discharges have relatively low energy compared to a full insulation breakdown, over time they can accumulate damage in the insulation, increasing the risk of its failure.   

## Here are some primary causes of PD:   

1. **Dielectric inclusions:**  These are areas in the insulation with a relatively low dielectric permittivity compared to the main material. Such inclusions can become sources of PD.   
2. **Surface discontinuities:** These include cracks, bubbles, or other surface defects.   
3. Electrodes with sharp edges: Sharp edges can concentrate high electric stresses, leading to the occurrence of PD.   
4. High-voltage jumps: This refers to differences in potential between different parts of the system.

The action of partial discharges can lead to the chemical decomposition of the material, thermal damages, and the formation of microscopic cracks. Over time, these processes can degrade the quality of the insulation and elevate the risk of its breakdown.   

To calculate the energy of PD, it's essential to determine the voltage at the moment they occur. The energy of PD is calculated using "formula". To calculate the equivalent capacitance, the "formula" is used. It's worth noting that this method is approximate since, under certain conditions, PD can be described as an equivalent capacitance.
